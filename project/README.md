## My Silly Toy

This program is a silly toy that runs on an msp430. The behavior for each
button is:
- S1: Plays Canon in D while snow falls on a cute little robot
- S2: Shows an inspirational quote in 5x7 font
- S3: Plays a sound that goes from low to high and high to low, simulating a
siren. It also adds circles to the screen
- S4: Every time it is pressed, a rectangle is drawn inside the previous
rectangle and the note is changed
